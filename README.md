# Hisab

Hisab is a mobile-first Progressive Web App for personal expenses, shared expenses, informal loans, borrowed/lent items, and recurring bills. The app is now built for Vercel hosting with a Postgres backend.

## Architecture

- React + TypeScript + Vite for the PWA frontend.
- Vercel `/api` serverless functions for backend endpoints.
- Postgres for accounts, sessions, admin controls, and finance data.
- Server-side email/password authentication with salted PBKDF2 hashes.
- HTTP-only session cookie.
- Superadmin authorization enforced in API handlers.
- Zustand stores call backend APIs and keep UI state.
- Tailwind CSS, React Router, Zod, date-fns, Recharts.

## Environment

`.env.local` is used for local development and is ignored by git.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:your-local-password@localhost:5432/hisab
AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
SUPERADMIN_EMAIL=admin@hisab.local
SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD=change-this-password
SUPERADMIN_NAME=Hisab Superadmin
```

For Vercel, add equivalent environment variables in Project Settings.

Use a managed Postgres database for Vercel, such as Vercel Postgres, Neon, Supabase Postgres, or another hosted Postgres provider. A local Postgres database on your PC is only for development.

## Local Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create DB, run schema, and seed the single superadmin:

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

Run the Vercel-compatible dev server:

```bash
npm run api:dev
```

Use the seeded superadmin:

```text
admin@hisab.local
change-this-password
```

Change these values in `.env.local` before using real data.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Lint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Deploy To Vercel

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Create/provision a Postgres database.
3. Add these environment variables in Vercel:

   ```text
   DATABASE_URL
   AUTH_SECRET
   SUPERADMIN_EMAIL
   SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD
   SUPERADMIN_NAME
   POSTGRES_SSL=true
   ```

4. Run migrations and seed against the production database:

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed
   ```

5. Import the GitHub repository into Vercel and deploy.

## Superadmin

The superadmin is seeded from environment variables. Regular users cannot create or promote superadmins.

Superadmin can:

- permanently delete accounts and all owned data
- clear account-owned data while keeping the login
- put accounts on hold / release hold
- reset regular user passwords
- disable or enable new account creation globally

Held accounts cannot sign in or load finance data. The seeded superadmin cannot hold, clear, delete, or reset its own account from the panel. Admin permissions are enforced in `api/admin.ts`, not only by frontend routing.

The superadmin experience is separated from the personal finance app. Superadmin sessions land on a platform dashboard and only show admin-focused navigation plus settings.

## Current Limitations

- JSON import is not implemented in Postgres mode yet.
- `Load demo` currently resets account data instead of seeding demo finance records.
- Offline mode caches the app shell, but finance data requires the backend.
- Password recovery and email verification are not implemented.
- Full offline sync can be added later with IndexedDB as a cache and sync queue.
